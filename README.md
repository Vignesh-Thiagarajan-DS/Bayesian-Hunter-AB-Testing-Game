<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>

* **Interactive Gameplay:** A simple and intuitive game where your choices directly impact the statistical model.
* **Real-Time Bayesian Visualization:** Watch the belief distributions for each chest update in real-time with every click.
* **Multiple Chart Types:** Switch between "Belief Curves" (Beta PDF) and "Best Guess" (Posterior Mean) to see the data from different perspectives.
* **Algorithmic Hints:** Get advice from two classic bandit algorithms‚Äî**Upper Confidence Bound** and **Epsilon-Greedy**‚Äîto compare your strategy against theirs.
* **In-Depth Explanations:** A dedicated pane explains the core mathematical concepts ($ \text{Beta Distribution}, \text{UCB Formula}$, etc.) with live stats from your game session.

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts Demonstrated</h2>

<h3 align="center">A/B Testing Framework</h3>

> The concept is simple and powerful: you create two or more versions of something (an ad, a webpage, a button), show them to different segments of your audience, and let the data tell you which one performs better. It‚Äôs a controlled experiment that takes the guesswork out of decision-making.

> In a traditional A/B test, you must commit to a fixed ‚Äúexploration‚Äù period. You might decide to show Version A to some % of your users and Version B to the rest until you reach statistical significance.

<h3 align="center">The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</h3>

> This is a classic thought experiment where a gambler must choose which slot machine ("one-armed bandit") to play, each with a different hidden payout rate. The goal is to maximize winnings by quickly identifying the best machine. This serves as a powerful analogy for many real-world problems like A/B testing, clinical trials, and resource allocation.

<h3 align="center">Bayesian Inference & The Beta-Bernoulli Model</h3>

> The game uses a **Bayesian approach** to learn about the chests. Instead of just calculating a simple win rate, we maintain a **probability distribution of our belief** for each chest's true payout rate. We start with an uncertain belief, and with each click, we update that belief using the new evidence. This is Bayes' Theorem in action:
> $$ P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta) \cdot P(\theta)}{P(D)} $$
> Where Œ∏ is our belief about the payout rate and D is the new data (evidence).

<h3 align="center">The Explore-Exploit Tradeoff</h3>

> This is the fundamental dilemma of the game:
> * **Exploitation:** Do you keep opening the chest that has given you the most treasure so far? This maximizes your immediate, known rewards.
> * **Exploration:** Do you try other, less-known chests to gather more data, just in case one of them is secretly the best one? This invests resources for a potentially higher long-term reward.
