## Key Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** A simple and intuitive game where your choices directly impact the statistical model.
* **Real-Time Bayesian Visualization:** Watch the belief distributions for each chest update in real-time with every click.
* **Multiple Chart Types:** Switch between "Belief Curves" (Beta PDF) and "Best Guess" (Posterior Mean) to see the data from different perspectives.
* **Algorithmic Hints:** Get advice from two classic bandit algorithms‚Äî**Upper Confidence Bound** and **Epsilon-Greedy**‚Äîto compare your strategy against theirs.
* **In-Depth Explanations:** A dedicated pane explains the core mathematical concepts ($ \text{Beta Distribution}, \text{UCB Formula}$, etc.) with live stats from your game session.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

<h3 align="center">The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</h3>

> This is a classic thought experiment where a gambler must choose which slot machine ("one-armed bandit") to play, each with a different hidden payout rate. The goal is to maximize winnings by quickly identifying the best machine. This serves as a powerful analogy for many real-world problems like A/B testing, clinical trials, and resource allocation.

<h3 align="center">Bayesian Inference & The Beta-Bernoulli Model</h3>

> The game uses a **Bayesian approach** to learn about the chests. Instead of just calculating a simple win rate, we maintain a **probability distribution of our belief** for each chest's true payout rate. We start with an uncertain belief (**Beta Distribution**), and with each click (a **Bernoulli Trial**), we update that belief using the new evidence. The core idea is:
> $$ P(\text{belief} | \text{evidence}) \propto P(\text{evidence} | \text{belief}) \cdot P(\text{prior belief}) $$

<h3 align="center">The Explore-Exploit Tradeoff</h3>

> This is the fundamental dilemma of the game:
> * **Exploitation:** Do you keep opening the chest that has given you the most treasure so far? This maximizes your immediate, known rewards.
> * **Exploration:** Do you try other, less-known chests to gather more data, just in case one of them is secretly the best one? This invests resources for a potentially higher long-term reward.

## How to Run Locally

To run this application on your local machine, please follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vignesh-Thiagarajan-DS/Bayesian-Hunter-AB-Testing-Game.git](https://github.com/Vignesh-Thiagarajan-DS/Bayesian-Hunter-AB-Testing-Game.git)
    cd Bayesian-Hunter-AB-Testing-Game
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Mac/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(First, make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal.)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
The application should now be open in your web browser!
