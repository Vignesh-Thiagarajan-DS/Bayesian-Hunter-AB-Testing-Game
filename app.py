Welcome to Bandit Hunter! You have **100 keys** to open five treasure chests. 
Each chest has a different, secret probability of containing treasure. Your goal is to maximize your winnings.

This game is a live simulation of a **multi-armed bandit problem**, a classic dilemma in data science. 
As you play, the chart on the right will update your *belief* about each chest's payout rate. 
Will you **exploit** the chest you think is best, or **explore** others to gather more data?
